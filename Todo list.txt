To do

- Redesign layout with Bootstrap
- Create a hint drop-down box with sweets representing the number of items in the question
- Simplify the division, so it generates a remainder
- Zoom into the each operatioN as the button is clicked
- Create a navigation bar e.g Home | Add | Minus

- Experiment with more user friendly ways of input - zooming into the input box and maybe a star button to show the user is done


Ues transform - transition css to move from one image to another
Use relative/absolute positioning
Use after css function to display the squiggle from the text box
Use bootstrap modal for the message box

Possibly add z index or keyframes to layer items on the page. or may just be able to order items on the page

Could create different boy images so that the expression changes based on the layout
